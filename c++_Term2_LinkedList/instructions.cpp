// The data will store the value of the node and the next pointer will store the address of the next node in the sequence.
// For doubly linked list you will have to add an addition pointer prev that will store the address of the prev node in the sequence.

//2. Define a class LINKEDLIST consisting of all the MEMEBER FUNCTIONS for the LinkedList and a HEAD POINTER that will store the reference of a particular linked list.
//Initialize the HEAD to NULL as the linked list is empty initially.

//3. Implement basic functions that will manipulate the elements of the linked list.
// insertAtBeginning, 
// insertAtEnd, 
// deleteFromBeginning, 
// deleteFromEnd
